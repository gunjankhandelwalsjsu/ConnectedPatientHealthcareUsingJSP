                        I am planning to take an initiative to get the library hours of our university extended. I have always wanted to stay longer in the university during night and study in its silent and calm environment. I believe night is the best time we can finish all our assignments and study with some concentration during this month of exam. We students who are living an independent life out here will certainly have to manage our time with all other daily work through the day as well and hence night is the best time I personally can spend on studies. I would like to gather opinions from students from different discipline and hence decided to blog this post. I could only think of advantages from this change. Isn't this going to help all the students who would like to have extended hours of peaceful studies at the library?
